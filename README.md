# My question:  In the "Example_Glade.py + Example_Glade.glade" example, why does the ScrolledWindow not expand to full display the contents of the TreeView widget?  What do I need to do to correct this?

##

## Files

There are 2 programs that do the same thing here.

#1:  Example_GPT.py
* This was written by ChatGPT as an example to get me started.  This works and the TreeView is fully displayed.

#2:  Example_Glade.py + Example_Glade.glade
* This was written by me using Glade for the UI.  This works, but the ScrolledWindow is not expanded to fully display the contents of the TreeView widget.
